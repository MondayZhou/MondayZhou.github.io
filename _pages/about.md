Hi! I’m Yidong Joey Zhou, a researcher and PhD student under the guidance of Professor [Bo Yuan](https://sites.google.com/site/boyuaneecs/home?authuser=0) at Rutgers University. I am also under the guidance of Professor [Zhiding Liang](https://www.innovationadvancedlab.com/home) at CUHK. Before that, I obtained my M.S. from Brown University Department of Physics, advised by Professor [Brad Marston](https://sites.brown.edu/bradmarston/), and my B.S. from Nankai Univeristy. You can find my full academic CV [here](../assets/pdf/YidongZhou_CV.pdf).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **quantum computing, system architecture, and high-performance computing (HPC)**:

- **Quantum Reliability**: Understanding and improving fault tolerance through quantum error correction and noise-aware system design.  
- **Quantum Architecture**: Bridging hardware and algorithms via hardware-aware compilation, co-design, and scalable quantum systems.  
- **Quantum Algorithms and Applications**: Developing practical quantum algorithms and workflows for optimization and scientific applications on realistic devices.  
- **Quantum × HPC**: Exploring the integration of quantum computing with high-performance computing, including hybrid quantum–classical workflows and system-level co-design.

I am interested in potential research collaboration or internship opportunities. If you have any questions about my work or potential cooperation, please feel free to reach out.
