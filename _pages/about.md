Hi! I’m Yidong Joey Zhou, a researcher under the guidance of Professor Zhiding Liang at RPI. My work focuses on quantum error correction, quantum architecture, and the development of quantum algorithms and applications. I am also passionate about the intersection of AI and quantum computing, exploring both AI’s role in advancing quantum systems and the potential of quantum technologies to enhance AI.

I aim to address fundamental challenges in quantum computing while driving practical innovations across various domains, including optimization, drug discovery, and more. My research equally emphasizes quantum system design and the application of quantum algorithms bridging theory and application at the frontiers of science.

Collaboration across disciplines is central to my approach, and I thrive in environments that connect quantum technology, physics, and AI. My goal is to leverage these intersections to push scientific boundaries and deliver solutions with real-world impact.
